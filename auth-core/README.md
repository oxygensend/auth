# Auth core

- The core module of the authentication service. It contains the main domain logic and application services for
  authentication, authorization and user management.

- Designed to be framework-agnostic and can be integrated with any backend.

- All other modules are optional extensions that depend on auth-core (e.g., storage implementations, message brokers).

- By default, it uses Spring Application Events to publish domain events â€” allowing you to listen and react to them in
  your application.

## Integration

To use or extend the functionality in your application:

- Add the desired module (e.g., auth-core) as a dependency to your project via Maven or Gradle.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.oxygensend.auth</groupId>
    <artifactId>auth-core</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

- Customize or extend the logic as needed.
